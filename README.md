## Things implemented
1. all the filenames use kebab-casing as the Google search engine treats a hyphen as a word separator therefore helping in seo

3. added accessibility options - like screen-reader, alt for images etc
4. keep in mind the performance - 
  - async loading of non-vital js
  - using woff instead of ttf
  - using webp format for images

5. css is cross-browser compatible
6. made use of html5 semantics
7. highly responsive, both mobile, tablets and computers
8. move to top button and list of content, for ease of navigation
9. easily customizable callout icon button in css

etc...
