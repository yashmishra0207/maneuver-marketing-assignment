            Women have always been known to have great intuition, especially
            when it comes to their body reacting to certain conditions -
            emotionally, mentally or physically.
          </p>
          <p class="card">
            These “feelings” tend to get “out of control” during specific phases
            of our life, the kind that we see in movies but have not explicitly
            discussed before it happens.
          </p>
          <p class="card">
            We start to sense a shift in the way our body works; drastic mood
            swings with frequent tears or outbursts.

          Understanding and accepting these symptoms can help us simplify the
          process of solving them (as promised, as easy as 1, 2, 3)!

        <p>Let us start with understanding the 3 stages of Menopause:</p>

        <article id="three-stages-of-menopause-perimenopause">
          <h2 class="header-2">Perimenopause</h2>
          <p>
            Perimenopause or Premenopause can begin several years before
            menopause. This could last between a few months to about 10 years.
            However, on average it lasts about 4 years.
          </p>
          <p>What happens?</p>

          <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="card">
              <h3>Ovaries start to gradually lower estrogen production.</h3>
              <p>
                This is a natural process of growing older and usually starts
                around the age of 40. In some cases, it could start as early as
                when women are in their 30s.
              </p>
              <p>
                This could mean a reduction in our fertility rate, therefore,
                women looking to start a family should try and utilize every
                open opportunity with their partner!
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
              <h3>Changes in the menstrual/period cycle</h3>
              <p>
                The horror stories begin with the change in duration of our
                menstrual cycle- there could be longer gaps between periods or
                spotting between 2 cycles.
              </p>
              <p>
                Like, the frustration of not knowing when you will get your
                period next is not enough; the flow would differ too, making it
                heavier or lighter over time.

            <div class="card">
              <h3>Intensified PMS (premenstrual syndrome)</h3>
              <p>
                Intensified PMS (premenstrual syndrome) Drastic and frequent
                mood swings are the most common signals, along with increased
                insomnia or hot flashes.
              </p>
              <p>
                This could increase our irritability level, losing our energy
                levels; getting tired even after sitting at work the entire day
                or taking longer weekend naps to recover from our workweek would
                be common.

          <h2 class="header-2">Menopause</h2>
          <p>
            The official menopause stage begins 12 months after the last
            menstrual period (bleeding).
          </p>
          <p>What happens?</p>

          <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="card">
              <h3>Ovaries stop releasing eggs.</h3>
              <p>This means there would be minimal production of estrogen.</p>
              <p>
                At this stage, getting pregnant could be significantly harder.
                Hence, we notice the use of hormonal therapy or IVF for
                childbirth.
              </p>
              <p>
                We start feeling “low”, with the constant need to cuddle in bed
                and watch Netflix instead of going out and getting drinks with
                our girlfriends.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
              <h3>Intensified hot flashes and night sweats.</h3>
              <p>
                Waking up in the middle of the night, aggressively throwing our
                blanket away or turning your fan on max even though the aircon
                is on full blast.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our body starts to feel warm or hot suddenly, with flushed red
                skin and increased heart rate; followed by suddenly feeling
                cold.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
              <h3>Significant physical changes.</h3>
              <p>
                The concept of “a minute on your lip, a lifetime on your hip”
                comes to reality. Eating one slice of cake for dinner could
                increase weight around our waist and abdominal region, with a
                reduction in our metabolic rate."
              </p>
              <p>
                It is also common to notice our hair and skin becoming drier and
                thinner; no amount of conditioner and lotion seem to absolutely
                solve this problem.

          <p>
            Yes, the troubles don't end right at menopause. It is the stage
            where most of the severe menopausal symptoms decrease but it comes
            with additional side effects.
          </p>

          <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="card">
              <h3>Increase in Follicle Stimulating Hormones (FSH)</h3>
              <p>
                This increases dramatically as our ovaries shut down and
                drastically lower the level of estrogen in our body.
              </p>
              <p>
                By this point, we started noticing a lowered energy level -
                sleeping in by 7/8 P.M. after work is a norm.

              <h3>Higher risk of certain health conditions.</h3>
              <p>
                Some of the common health problems that occur during
                postmenopause are diabetes, joint pains, osteoporosis,
                cholesterol and heart disease.
              </p>
              <p>
                This could be an alarming phase, where every visit to the doctor
                is like drawing a lottery ticket- we need to maintain a healthy
                lifestyle to combat such possibilities.

        </ol>
        <p>
          Going through menopause by yourself is hard! Especially because it
          affects our daily life! Symptoms like reduction in metabolic rates and
          estrogen levels that cause weight gain and increase the size of our
          abdomen; night sweats and flashes, joint pains that make us feel 30
          years older...are just to name a few.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, we have broken down understanding and solving menopause in
          3 easy steps; which can make this journey a little less frustrating!
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope you can see that menopause does not have to be difficult and
          solving it can be as easy as 1, 2, 3!
